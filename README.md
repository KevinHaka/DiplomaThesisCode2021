# Computational simulation of disease spread and connection to diffusion phenomena
In this repository, you can find the codes from my thesis, which simulate the spreading of a disease.

* The <b>Disease spread simulation</b> folder contains the general-purpose code.
* The <b>SIR_DSS</b> folder contains the code that reproduces the curves from the theoretical model <b>SIR</b>, with simulations of the phenomenon.
* The <b>R0_DSS</b> folder contains the code that calculates the basic reproductive number (<b>R<sub>0</sub></b>), which is the expected
  number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection.
* The <b>R(t)_DSS</b> folder contains the code that calculates the effective reproduction number (<b>R<sub>t</sub></b>), which shows us the
  average number of new infections caused by a single infected individual at time <b>t</b> in the partially susceptible population.
